# linked list
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration
- linked lists doesn't have indexexes
- ll first item called `Head`
- ll last item called `tail`
- in linked list each item points to the next item
- last item points to the `none` 
- each node spreads out in different places in memory

# advantages over list
insertion and deletion are very quick. depend on item postition
